# OOP-Group-project-linear-Game
 This was our first Python project where we worked in a group with each focusing on one level to create a detailed linear game with mini-games, world-building and music

Everything under the "Cian" folder is my work however we worked on this project for several weeks in person allowing us all to contribute to the project as a whole

## Project brief

Assignment: Group Game Expansion

Introduction:
In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to collaborate in groups (4-6 students per group) to expand upon our text-driven mystery game using your knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP) and Python. The objective of this assignment is to further develop and enrich the game by applying key OOP concepts, emphasizing clean coding practices, teamwork, and ethical considerations.

Assignment Objectives:
By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

1.	Apply your understanding of OOP concepts, including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstract classes, in a practical project. Topics that are still to come, for example exception handling, file handling, and modules should be incorporated into the game as appropriate.
2.	Develop clean, well-documented code that ensures the maintainability and readability of the expanded game.
3.	Work effectively as part of a team, fostering collaboration, communication, and division of responsibilities.
4.	Test and debug code to ensure the expanded game functions correctly and is error-free.
5.	Maintain ethical standards in your group dynamics, respecting the contributions and privacy of fellow students.
6.	Showcase your creativity by designing new character interactions, scenarios, and gameplay mechanics.
7.	Document your code and present your expanded game to the class, providing insights into your design choices and coding practices.

Assignment Details:
Game Expansion Scope: You will work in groups of 4-6 students to expand the existing text-driven mystery game. The expansion should include new character interactions, scenarios, and gameplay mechanics. A list of possible expansions is provided below and should be seen as inspiration rather than a definite or exhaustive list. Each group should decide on specific and unique enhancements. Any deviation from the expected group size will half the group mark for this assignment.

Ethical Considerations: When expanding the game, maintain ethical standards in your group dynamics. Do not use other students' names or identities for the game without their consent. Always respect the contributions and privacy of fellow students. The game should create a safe and inclusive environment for all participants.

Coding Standards: Code quality and readability are important. Ensure that your code adheres to clean coding practices, including proper indentation, informative variable names, and in-code comments to explain complex logic. The same guidelines apply that were part of your lab rubrics.

Documentation and Presentation: Each group should document their code. The code header must contain an overview of the specific expansions tackled by the group, see example below. The group prepares a brief game play presentation (5-10 minutes) to showcase their expanded game to the lab TA. Each member of the group will have to answer a question that the TA asks you during this presentation. These questions may include insights into your design choices, coding practices, and challenges you encountered during the expansion.
