Program Description:

This program features four locations - LuminousLake, WhisperingGrove,
 CanopyWalkway, and EchoingCaverns - each inheriting from the 'Area' base
class.

1.  LuminousLake: A serene lake setting where players can discover items like
    'Luminous Plank' and 'Ancient Paper.' The environment is interactive,
    allowing players to explore and collect items that aid in their journey.

2.  WhisperingGrove: This location features an old man NPC who provides clues
    and engages the player in a quest to find an ancient paper. It emphasizes
    narrative-driven exploration, with a focus on dialogue and item collection.

3.  CanopyWalkway: Set atop the forest canopy, this area introduces Shroomy
    Dundee, a humorous NPC who offers riddles and rewards for player engagement
    The location is designed for players to solve puzzles and interact with the
    environment, highlighting the importance of exploration and decision-making

4.  EchoingCaverns: A environment where players encounter the
    Chromatic Trio, NPCs who challenge the player with a color-based riddle.
    The area requires players to use specific items like 'Glowing Rock' to
    navigate and unravel the mysteries within. It combines puzzle-solving
    with narrative elements, enhancing the depth and engagement of the game.

    Each location is crafted to enrich the game's world, offering diverse
    experiences through interactive storytelling, puzzles, and character
    interactions.
